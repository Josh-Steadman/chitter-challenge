Chitter Challenge
=================

Our third fourth challenge required us to create a web app that allowed a user sign_in and post peeps. The user could write whatever they are feeling and the posts should come up in chronological order with the time and username on the post.

- Had to use knowledge of Object Oriented Programming to allow classes to interact
- Used the MVC pattern to create the web app itself
- required the use of GET and POST requests
- wrapped database data in ruby objects

## Tests ##

Tests are made using the rspec ruby gem and capybara gem. 

First install rspec by running this in your terminal: 'gem install rspec'  

Run 'rspec' in your terminal when inside the 'RPS' directory to use them.
